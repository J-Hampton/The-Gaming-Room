# The-Gaming-Room

The Gaming Room is a gaming software company. Theyhave an existing game called draw it or lose it that they want to make available for multiple platforms, Windows, Mac, Linux, and Mobile platforms via a web application. 

I think I did a very thorough job of drafting the recommandations with good examples and explanations. 

Creating the design document helped me to work through the program development process before writing the code making it a faster to develop and allowed me to think of possible problems before they occur.

I would revise the Evaluation section if I could. I believe I could give more thorough information if given the chance.

I used the information provided to inform my decision by weighing the pros and cons of serverless vs traditional operating platforms. It is important to listen to the clients needs to give the best performance and use the best programming languages and platforms available.

I used the client server architecture and incrementor architecture to create code that is efficient and easy to read. I would use these same architecture types in the future where appropriate.
